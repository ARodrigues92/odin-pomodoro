# Pomodoro 

This is a pomodoro timer built as a project for the Odin course. It consists of two timers, one for work with a default value of 25 minutes and one for resting with a default value of 5. You can increase and decrease this times by pressing the arrows as well as start, pause, stop or reset the clock with the appropriate buttons. At the end of each time the clock will emit an alarm sound and the next timer will begin.

## Thoughts on the project

Even thought simple, this was a very interesting and somewhat challenging project that introduced various new and interesting concepts, such as:

- The CSS transform property to add some simple animations to the buttons.
- Creating object constructors and workign with the created objects.
- The setTimeut and setInterval methods.
- Adding sounds.
